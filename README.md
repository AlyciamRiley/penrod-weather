## Penrod Weather
 This application used the OpenWeather API to display the current weather conditions for the Penrod Offices located in Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Dallas, and Chicago. 

## Technologies Used
- Mithril.js
- Lightning Design System
- Node.js
- Webpack
- Express

## Motivation
I chose to use the Mithril framework as it is a simplified version of other single page frameworks like React and Angular. This is a small application, but Mithril is highly scalable as it allows for creating separate components and routing when more features are needed.
